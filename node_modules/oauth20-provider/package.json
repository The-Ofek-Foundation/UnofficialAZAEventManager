Supports all the four authorization flows: authorization code, implicit, client credentials, password.\n\n___One more oAuth 2.0 service provider? Yes!___\n\n- Based on the final specification *[RFC6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749 \"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework Specification\")*\n- Fully customizable and extremely flexible\n- Test covered\n- Contains integration examples\n\n## Installation ##\n\n    $ npm install oauth20-provider\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n## Usage ##\n\n> Look into .\"/test/server/ directory\" for working example with in-memory and redis storage models.\n\n### Step 1. Define your models and decision controller ###\n\nBy default module sets abstract models which should be redefined, library does not force any implementation.\n\n### Refresh token model ###\n\nRefresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner). *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)*\n\n___Redefinable functions___\nLook at \"./lib/model/refreshToken.js\" for further information.\n\n### Access token model ###\n\nAccess tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server. *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4)*\n\n___Redefinable functions___\nLook at \"./lib/model/accessToken.js\" for further information.\n\n### Client model ###\n\nBefore initiating the protocol, the client registers with the authorization server.  The means through which the client registers with the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML registration form. *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2)*\n\n___Redefinable functions___\nLook at \"./lib/model/client.js\" for further information.\n\n### Code model ###\n\nThe authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner. User only by authorization code flow, no need to initialize it if one don't use this grant. *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1)*\n\n___Redefinable functions___\nLook at \"./lib/model/code.js\" for further information.\n\n### User model ###\n\nUser is a registered person in the service. Model should contain unique identifier, password and sometimes additional unique key (for example username/email). There is no common scheme for this type of object, feel free to implement it your way.\n\n___Redefinable functions___\nLook at \"./lib/model/user.js\" for further information.\n\n### Decision controller ###\n\nPage is used to ask user whether user agree or not to allow client to access his information with current scope. Controller should return POST form with decision parameter (0 - user does not allow, 1 - user allows).\n\n___Redefinable___\nLook at \"./controller/authorization/decision.js\" for further information.\n\n### Step 2. Inject and Define Endpoints ###\n\nFirst of all include and initialize **oauth20-provider** library:\n```js\noauth2lib = require('./oauth20-provider.js');\noauth2 = new oauth2lib({log: {level: 2}});\n```\n\nLibrary is compatible with express/connect servers, inject oauth2 into your server.\n```js\nserver.use(oauth2.inject());\n```\n\n___Token endpoint___\n\n```js\nserver.post('/token', oauth2.controller.token);\n```\n\n___Authorization endpoint___\n\n```js\nserver.get('/authorization', isAuthorized, oauth2.controller.authorization, function(req, res) {\n    // Render our decision page\n    // Look into ./test/server for further information\n    res.render('authorization', {layout: false});\n});\nserver.post('/authorization', isAuthorized, oauth2.controller.authorization);\n```\n\nMiddleware **isAuthorized** is used to check user login. If user is not logged in - show authorization form instead. Simple implementation:\n\n```js\nfunction isAuthorized(req, res, next) {\n    if (req.session.authorized) next();\n    else {\n        var params = req.query;\n        params.backUrl = req.path;\n        res.redirect('/login?' + query.stringify(params));\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Step 3. Relax ###\n\nYour authorization server is ready for work.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n### ToDo list and future plans ###\n\n- Add examples (mongodb, postgresql)\n- Allow multiple flows for single client (only 1 per client works well yet)\n- Add refresh token TTL\n- Implement proper \"TTL\" support for accessToken and scope objects\n- Add MAC token type\n- Allow client authentication via query parameters\n- More tests\n- More docs\n- Build example site\n- Check RFC once more\n\n### License ###\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Tim Shamilov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
